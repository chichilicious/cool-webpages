                <p>They say it takes an average 21days to form a habit. Little was I prepared for how attached I'd get to what
                    has been my temporary home over this past 30days. With the mindset of a not-so-typical desi traveller,
                    first US visit was supposed to ideally be vacationing visiting family and tourist attractions, right?
                    But guess this magical country had other plans- welcomed by American winter I was totally unprepared
                    for; getting to experience and travel to places I've only dreamed about all my life; challenged to step
                    outside my comfort zone in order to make amends to self behavioral attributes; questioned about life's
                    stage by self-introspection; getting to come across the warmest and sweetest people (you know who you
                    are!). Distance makes the heart fonder, sure, but so does closeness when feelings, relationships and
                    things are valued with appreciation. America, you beautiful addiction, you are a tattoo now etched all
                    over me. Thank you for the said and unsaid. With this clarity, here's the deal- I'll work on my priority
                    and you prove to me you're the land of opportunities. See you, East Coast. Until next time! S.</p>

                <p>They say if a friendship lasts for 7years, it'll last a lifetime. I'm glad you proved this wrong because
                    it's been 5years-8months, the day you called me when I shyly tried to runaway from introducing myself
                    to you (Communication assignment). And today, look at where we are- Best Friends Forever! It's such a
                    pleasure to witness you evolve in front of us (and in the process, somewhere, I grew myself). Everyone
                    apart, you know that words are a mere amalgamation of alphabets for me to express how special you are.
                    I'm luckyto be part of your last minutes in Bangalore. And I see this only as a new chapter to be started
                    in our lives.‚úå Cheers to you, Gifty. All I'm left to say is- Sorry and Thank You!---with gifty and aneesh</p>
                <p>...There's so much that I can't see. Who knows? Is this the start of something wonderful and new? Or one
                    more dream that I cannot make true?</p>
