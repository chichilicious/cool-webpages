                        <p>"What is the meaning of life? Are we here for a reason? Is there a point to any of this?"</p>
                        <p>"Ancient species owned this earth long before mankind... This world never belonged to us, it belongs
                            to THEM. The only question is how long we have before they take it back."</p>
                        <p>"Career before Love!<br> Love before career? - You're just distracted."
                        </p>
                        <p>Early long days at work; healthy food; priorities to the point; compromises for a better tomorrow;
                            career in focus; welcoming changes; once available now occupied; less talks and more patience
                            for a tolerant today. Such is life, or so has it become</p>
                        <p>"What if you came here for a different reason today? What if you went away with something better?"

                        </p>
                        <p>"Zindagi mein jab koi pattern banta ya koi aadat banti dikhai de na toh uske baare mein achchi tarah
                            se sochna chahiye. Genius is about knowing when to stop."</p>
                        <p>"I used to want to save the world, this beautiful place. But the closer you get, the more you see
                            the great darkness within. I learnt this the hard way, a long, long time ago."

                        </p>
                        <p>I'm in a relationship with myself for 28 years. And that's the one I work on!</p>
                        <p>One thing I've learnt about maturity is realizing I don't hate anything-and-everything anymore; things
                            either matter or they don't. I'm in the process of walking away from that which threatens my
                            peace!
                        </p>
                        <p>Smart Dressing: Because I dress for my amusement wearing my mood. It's an abstract, of having a conversation
                            with oneself</p>
                        <p>Be your own Superman/ Superwoman/ Superperson because only you can save you!</p>
