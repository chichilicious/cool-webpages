        <p><strong> Scott :</strong> How has 2016 been for you?<br><strong> Sharath Iyengar:</strong> has been my most "experiential" year- personally, professionally,
            emotionally and psychologically. From switching to a new role 1 step closer to my career aspiration to visiting
            a new continent I've been wanting to since childhood. When I self-introspect, I see me feel & be stronger mentally,
            I'm more confident and have taken experimenting to a new different higher level. And I'm only going to continue
            doing so in coming 2017.</p>
