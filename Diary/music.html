            <p>♬ "I'm jealous, I'm overzealous. When I'm down, I get real down; when I'm high, I don't come down. I get angry,
                believe me. I could love you just like that and I could leave you just as fast. But you don't judge me 'cause
                if you did, I would judge you too. 'Cause I got issues..." ♬</p>
            <p>♬ "... if you touch my skin, you once my thirst<br> Oh! I'm gonna freak out. Tell me what you're gonna do.<br>                Tell me what you're gonna do, no! No! No! No! No! No! Not...<br> It's getting hotter, I can't take much more
                (I need you)<br> Hey mom, hey mom, hey mom, hey ma '..." ♬
            </p>
            <p>♬ "...Despacito! Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito<br> Deja que te diga cosas al oído<br> Para que te acuerdes
                si no estás conmigo<br> Despacito! Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito<br> Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto<br>                Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito..." ♬
            </p>
            <p>♬ "...And I was like take off, take off, take off all of your clothes<br> They say only the good die young, that
                just ain't right<br> 'Cause we're having too much fun, too much fun tonight<br> Yeah! And a lust for life
                keeps us alive..." ♬<br>

            </p>
            <p>♬ "...This s**t way too crazy (Aye)! You do not amaze me (Aye)!<br> I don't fabricate it (Aye)! Most of ya'll
                be fakin' (Aye)!<br> I stay modest bout it (Aye)! B***h, be humble<br> (Hol' up b***h), sit down..." ♬<br>
            </p>
            <p>♬ "...I just know I feel so good<br> Don't you know I feel so good?<br> Don't you know, don't you know?<br> Tonight!"

            </p>
            <p>♬ "...Told him, "Good luck with the next one."<br> Maybe she'll be just as immature<br> Gotta thank him, he's
                the reason<br> That I know now what I'm looking for<br> Guys my age don't know how to treat me..." ♬<br>
            </p>
            <p>♬ "...F**k fake friends, we don't need 'em; I've had it up to the ceiling. F**k fake friends, we don't need 'em;
                only thing they're good for is leaving. And I ain't got the time, money on my mind; I'll say it to your face-
                f**k fake friends..." ♬ .
            </p>
            <p>♬ "So I got edges that scratch and sometimes I don't got a filter but I'm so tired of eating all of my misspoken
                words. I know my disposition gets confusing, my disproportionate reactions fuse with my eager state... My
                words can come out as a pistol and I'm no good at aiming. I know my actions, they may get confusing but my
                unstable ways is my solution to even space..." ♬</p>
            <p>♬ "I hang on everything that you say. You know, I can see all the things that imply. And finally when I let myself
                fall hard, I see you try to pretend like I’m making it up. This is what it feels like. Bring it down, bring
                it on; It’s getting old..." ♬</p>
            <p>♬ "I don't like my mind right now, stacking up problems that are so unnecessary. Wish that I could slow things
                down, I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic and I drive myself crazy thinking everything's about
                me... I'm holding on, why is everything so heavy? Holding on to so much more than I can carry. I keep dragging
                around what's bringing me down, if I just let go I'd be set free..." ♬</p>
            <p>♬ "...What do you do when a chapter ends? Do you close the book and never read it again? Where do you go when
                your story's done? You can be who you were or who you'll become. Oh! If it all goes wrong, darling just hold
                on. The sun goes down and it comes back up. The world, it turns no matter what..." ♬ </p>
            <p>♬ "...I was broken from a young age, taking my sulking to the masses. Writing my poems for the few that looked
                at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me, singing from heart ache from the pain, take up my message from
                the veins. Speaking my lesson from the brain, seeing the beauty through the pain. You made me a believer..."
                ♬
            </p>
            <p>♬ "...I never listen 'cause I'm a hopeless romantic<br> When I should run for my life. <br> Honey, I don't understand
                it
                <br> 'Cause it's magic but it's tragic..." ♬ <br>
            </p>
            <p>♬ "...I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it..." ♬</p>
            <p>♬ "...And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy. I get ready, I get all dressed up to go nowhere
                in particular. It doesn't matter if I'm not enough for the future or the things to come. 'Cause I'm young
                and in love (I'm young and in love). Don't worry, baby!" ♬</p>
            <p>♬ "...You're just a lost boy with your head up in the clouds, never keep your feet on the ground. Always gonna
                fly away just because you know you can. Never gonna learn there's no such place as a 'Neverland'. You don't
                understand- you'll never grow up, you're never gonna be a man..." ♬</p>
            <p>♬ "...Money don't make me happy and a fella can't make me fancy. We smilin' for a whole 'nother reason, it's
                all smiles through all four seasons. Shinin', shinin', shinin, shinin', yeah! All of this winnin', I've been
                losin' my mind. Oh! Hold on, don't try to slow me down..." ♬</p>
            <p>♬ "...Please know that if somehow we make it alive and both get out on the other side, oh! this might be asking
                a lot- when it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once..." ♬</p>
            <p>♬ "...Here's to the ones who dream<br> Foolish as they may seem<br> Here's to the hearts that ache<br> Here's
                to the mess we make..." ♬<br>
            </p>
            <p>♬ "Been sittin' eyes wide open behind these four walls, hopin' you'll call. It's just a cruel existence like
                it's no point hopin' at all. Baby! I feel crazy, up all night and every day. Give me somethin', oh! but you
                say nothin'. What is happenin' to me? I don't wanna..." ♬ </p>
            <p>"You are my kind, classic mind and you look so fine. Mmm! Whose the first to speak? Speak it like a real freak.
                Voice in my head, in my bed, filled with you instead. Mmm! Taking your time, work my mind and I play with
                you. I play pretend it's so true, follow me down, listen 'round to the deep dark sound. Mmm! Don't doubt
                me babe, you make me wanna change. I can't when you say it like that. Oh! Got me falling right back. Oh!
                Let me f**k you right back. Oh! #</p>
            <p>"Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else. A rush, a glance, a touch, a dance, a look in somebody's
                eyes to light up the skies, to open the world and send it reeling. A voice that says, I'll be here and you'll
                be alright. I don't care if I know just where I will go 'cause all that I need is this crazy feeling- a rat-tat-tat
                on my heart, think I want it to stay. City of stars, are you shining just for me? City of stars, you never
                shined so brightly."</p>
