        <h2>#Twogirls</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time,<br> Two girls,<br> Exchanged smiles,<br> in a boring lecture.<br> It was a clash of,<br> A dreamer
            and a realist,<br> A sweetheart and a critic,<br> they were such an odd pair.<br> It took them a while,<br> To
            realize,<br> They were just the,<br> Missing pieces of a puzzle.<br> Click.
            <br> A flawless match.<br> Darling,



            <br> Have you noticed?<br> Pieces of a puzzle,<br> Are an oddity,<br> when they are kept apart.<br>
            <br> Oh,
            <br> These girls are a catastrophe.<br> They never shout their lungs out,<br> Or even quarrel.<br> But they go
            weeks,<br> Without sharing their emotions,<br> Or even pleasantries. <br>

            <br> oh,
            <br> their hearts burned,<br> with enough fire to burn mountains,<br> longing for their missing connection.<br>            Apologies and forgiveness,<br> echoed in their heads,<br> in silent whispers,<br> but was never formed into words.<br>            Until,
            <br> One of them gave in,<br> And uttered the magical words.<br>
            <em> I miss you.</em><br> Then their rhythm began,<br> They talked and laughed,<br> And hugged and Kissed,<br> Played
            nefarious games,<br> And Shared,<br> Secrets and sinful tales.<br>
            <br> Darling, They are a pair,<br> Soo beautiful,<br> that the universe is envious,<br> of the glitter they are
            dusted with.<br> They shine too brightly,<br> For the world to bare.<br> To witness such beauty,<br> In oneâ€™s
            existence,<br> Is itself a rarity,<br> And so are they.<br></p>
