            <p>Hey there gnanz, our friendship went from "when you coming ol?" to "come out, we're in front of your house" xD.
                I think we are definitly going to be friends forever because we've been through so many phases and successfully
                crossed them all. Phases where we haven't met or spoken properly for months, yet once we meet, it feels like
                we just met yesterday.My favorite phase was the GOT and football times when i used to get a commentry of
                it even though i was asleep and would only see the messege the next day and also the continuous copy-paste
                of messeges! The comfort level we share is something which is a product of years of friendship. 
                Love you more than paneer and dancing. xD #GSM4evaa.

            <p>Hi Gnana.Let me start by wishing you a Happy Happy Birthday.Clearly my closest and longest friendship.It's like
                we're setting Goal.My heart can only like and love a few too dearly and truly, you are definitely one of
                them.According to you everything needs to be sensible and reasonable, jokes included.They make you the person
                you are, also making the lives of people around you better.Starting from those times when I used to cycle
                on the streets of Hanumanthanagar bumping into you while playing cricket and still not knowing you stayed
                2 roads away from my place,till the times now when we don't even have to ask to get into each other house
                considering it to be our second home, we've been through a lot of good and bad times.Yet it all never bothered
                the untiring flow of friendship . Like I always say , good things in life are hard.So when you find them
                , you keep them forever.Okay, now this is too much talk to a person I meet everyday ,talking like I'm not
                going to see you for years and stuff.We still have a long way to go through in life . </p>
