        <p>Dear Galaxy,<br> You’re three faced. <br> Before you start frowning in frustration, let me elaborate your three faces.<br>            Firstly, you are the <em>infamous galaxy.</em><br> I’m still annoyed by the fact that everyone else started calling
            you “galaxy” when I have restrained myself from giving copyrights. It’s my nickname okay? I need some credit
            for recognizing your “galaxyness” and aptly naming you as one. I still smile when I recall how your mind automatically
            related every story I told to you. <br> Secondly, you are <em>Miss.Iggy.</em><br> Ah, I’m sure everyone is a
            victim of your “blue-ticking”. Do you remember I derived this nickname out of an entire sentence? I just got
            tired of typing ‘Tan, stop ignoring me’ or ‘Tanya? Why are you ignoring?’ every time I was prey to your blue-ticking,
            hence I went ahead and typed ‘Iggy’. Short and sweet with its beautiful message conveyed.<br> Thirdly,<em>kgirl.</em>            *wink emojis*<br> This is highly confidential information.<br> The number of indecent and extra personal questions
            I ask you, and dig the answers for the same are innumerable. I’m sure nobody else has dared to ask you or let
            alone mention such unmentionables in your presence. But hey? I recognized your ‘k’ness okay? Maybe others haven’t,
            but I know a vixen is hiding beneath that shy façade of yours, and is waiting to come out and explore the world.
            <br>
            <br> My dearest Iggy,<br> I will forever be your tormentor, persuader and the sweetest bully. <br> I will demand
            for those pictures and ask for red ribbons,<br> I shall try and persuade you to explore thy-womanhood,<br> And
            Make you uncomfortable by getting too close for comfort,<br> Or, Make you most uncomfortable by trying to kiss
            you (Oh, I will someday), <br> I love to scandalize you by telling you all of my ‘adventurous’ tales,<br> Or
            instantly forward my special pictures.<br> Above all,<br> I’m always there to listen to you while you talk, express,
            question, implore, laugh and shout.<br>
            <br> Oh, also, when (if) you have dirty secrets to tell, I’m <em>instantly available.</em> <br>
        </p>
